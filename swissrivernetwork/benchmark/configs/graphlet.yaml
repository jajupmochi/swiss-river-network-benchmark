num_samples: 200  # number of hyperparameter combinations to initialize the ray tuner with
# number of cpus to allocate to the ray tuner.
# - Non-positive values allocate all but that many cpus, e.g. -1 allocates all but 1 cpu. At least 1 cpu must be allocated.
# - Positive values allocate that many cpus. At most the number of available cpus can be allocated.
# - If None, use the default ray tuner behavior, which is to allocate all available cpus.
# Needs to be 4 if cpu per trial is 1 and gpu per trial is 0.25 and the machine has 4 cpus and 1 gpu. If set to 1,
# only 1 trial will run at a time even if gpu per trial is 0.25.
